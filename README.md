## My process

### Built with

Python using libraries such as:
- Panel
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib etc.

### What I learned

Learning about the panel libarary made this project a whole lot easier. From the documentations to the ease of implementation, panel was wonderful.

### Continued development

Can't wait for when it becomes easier to source a panel .ipynb or .py file into pyscript making it interactie on the web

### Useful resources

- [Panel](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Thu Vu Analytics Video](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
